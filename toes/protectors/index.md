### **Overview**

This is a council-style encounter against three bosses: Elder Regail, Elder Asani, and Protector Kaolan. You will engage all three simultaneously, but you will only need to defeat two of them to win the encounter. With your two-tank setup, you will be focusing on killing Elder Regail and Elder Asani first, as this is the most manageable strategy.

***

### **Tanks**

#### **Cmdrboxhead (Blood Death Knight) and Anziano (Guardian Druid)**

* **Cmdrboxhead (Blood Death Knight) - Elder Regail Tank:** You will be the primary tank on Elder Regail. He casts a stacking debuff, **Calamity**, which increases his damage. Taunt swap with Anziano at around 8-10 stacks to reset it.
* **Anziano (Guardian Druid) - Elder Asani and Protector Kaolan Tank:** You will need to manage both Elder Asani and Protector Kaolan.
    * **Elder Asani:** Position yourself with your back to the wall to mitigate her **Tidal Wave** knockback.
    * **Protector Kaolan:** Kaolan applies a stacking debuff, **Defiled Ground**, which deals damage over time and increases with each stack. You will need to use your defensive cooldowns to manage the damage from both bosses.
* **Coordination:** The entire fight depends on your communication and ability to manage these three bosses with only two tanks. You should place Elder Regail on one side of the room, and Anziano should position Elder Asani and Protector Kaolan on the other side.

### **Healers**

#### **Staceyxoxo (Mistweaver Monk) and Ennk (Discipline Priest)**

* **Tank Healing:** Your top priority is keeping Anziano alive. They will be taking a large amount of consistent damage from two bosses, including a stacking debuff from Protector Kaolan. This is where your major healing cooldowns should be used.
* **Raid Damage:** Be prepared for raid-wide damage from **Corrupted Water** and **Unleashed Dread**. Your most important job is to keep the raid topped up and prepared for the next burst of damage.
* **Spot Healing:** Be ready to heal players who are hit by **Unleashed Dread**, which will deal a large amount of damage to a random player.

### **Melee DPS**

#### **StabyStabby (Assassination Rogue) and Danifaye (Arms Warrior)**

* **Prioritize Regail:** Your main priority is to burn down **Elder Regail** first. Use all your cooldowns and single-target damage abilities on him. This will relieve pressure on the tanks.
* **Asani's Tide:** Be aware of Elder Asani's **Tidal Wave**. Be prepared for the knockback and move out of the way of the wave.
* **Avoid Shockwave:** Protector Kaolan will cast **Shockwave** which deals damage in a line and stuns anyone caught in it. Make sure to move out of the way when he begins to cast this ability.
* **Switch to Asani:** Once Regail is defeated, switch all your damage to **Elder Asani** to burn her down as quickly as possible. This will make the rest of the fight much easier on the tanks.

### **Ranged DPS**

#### **Shootinguatm (Beast Master Hunter), Zurk (Survival Hunter), Blonker (Survival Hunter), and Scumlyfe (Affliction Warlock)**

* **Prioritize Regail:** Your main priority is to burn down **Elder Regail** first. Use all your cooldowns and single-target damage abilities on him.
* **Stay Spread Out:** Asani's **Tainted Water** will create a void zone on the ground. Make sure you are spread out so that you don't all get hit by this ability.
* **Avoid Shockwave:** Protector Kaolan will cast **Shockwave** which deals damage in a line and stuns anyone caught in it. Make sure to move out of the way when he begins to cast this ability.
* **Switch to Asani:** Once Regail is defeated, switch all your damage to **Elder Asani** to burn her down as quickly as possible.
