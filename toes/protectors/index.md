### **Overview**

This is a council-style encounter against three bosses: Elder Regail, Elder Asani, and Protector Kaolan. You will engage all three simultaneously, but you will only need to defeat two of them to win the encounter. You'll be focusing on killing Elder Regail and Elder Asani first, leaving Protector Kaolan to despawn.

### **Tanks**

#### **Cmdrboxhead (Blood Death Knight) and Anziano (Guardian Druid)**

* **Elder Regail:** One of you should tank Elder Regail. He casts a stacking debuff, **Calamity**, which increases his damage. Taunt swap at around 8-10 stacks to reset it.
* **Elder Asani:** The other tank should pick up Elder Asani. She casts **Tidal Wave**, which will push you back. Position yourself with your back to the wall to avoid being knocked into the water.
* **Protector Kaolan:** **Protector Kaolan** doesn't need to be tanked in the traditional sense. He will be mostly static and will periodically cast abilities. The tank on Elder Asani should be ready to pick up any adds that spawn from him.
* **Coordinate:** You'll need to coordinate with each other to manage your taunt swaps on Regail and to handle any adds that spawn from the other bosses.

### **Healers**

#### **Staceyxoxoxo (Mistweaver Monk) and Ennk (Discipline Priest)**

* **Raid Damage:** Be prepared for raid-wide damage from **Corrupted Water** and **Unleashed Dread**. Your most important job is to keep the raid topped up and prepared for the next burst of damage.
* **Tank Healing:** Focus on healing the tank on Regail when his **Calamity** stacks get high.
* **Unleashed Dread:** Be ready to heal players who are hit by **Unleashed Dread**, which will deal a large amount of damage to a random player.

### **Melee DPS**

#### **StabyStabby (Assassination Rogue) and Danifaye (Arms Warrior)**

* **Prioritize Regail:** Your main priority is to burn down **Elder Regail** first. Use all your cooldowns and single-target damage abilities on him.
* **Asani's Tide:** Be aware of Elder Asani's **Tidal Wave**. Be prepared for the knockback and move out of the way of the wave.
* **Avoid Shockwave:** Protector Kaolan will cast **Shockwave** which deals damage in a line and stuns anyone caught in it. Make sure to move out of the way when he begins to cast this ability.
* **Switch to Asani:** Once Regail is defeated, switch all your damage to **Elder Asani** to burn her down as quickly as possible.

### **Ranged DPS**

#### **Shootinguatm (Beast Master Hunter), Zurk (Survival Hunter), Blonker (Survival Hunter), and Scumlyfe (Affliction Warlock)**

* **Prioritize Regail:** Your main priority is to burn down **Elder Regail** first. Use all your cooldowns and single-target damage abilities on him.
* **Stay Spread Out:** Asani's **Tainted Water** will create a void zone on the ground. Make sure you are spread out so that you don't all get hit by this ability.
* **Avoid Shockwave:** Protector Kaolan will cast **Shockwave** which deals damage in a line and stuns anyone caught in it. Make sure to move out of the way when he begins to cast this ability.
* **Switch to Asani:** Once Regail is defeated, switch all your damage to **Elder Asani** to burn her down as quickly as possible.
