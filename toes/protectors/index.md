Hello Cmdrboxhead and crew! Here are your instructions for the Protectors of the Endless encounter in Terrace of Endless Spring 10-man Normal mode.

### **Overview**

The Protectors of the Endless fight is a council-style encounter against three bosses: Elder Regail, Elder Asani, and Elder Tsulong. You will engage all three simultaneously, but you will only need to defeat two of them to win the encounter. You should be able to burn down Elder Regail (tank and spank) and Elder Tsulong (just stand in the light) and save Elder Asani for last.

### **Tanks**

#### **Cmdrboxhead (Blood Death Knight) and Anziano (Guardian Druid)**

* **Elder Regail:** One of you will need to tank Elder Regail. Taunt him when his stacks of **Calamity** get too high (around 8-10 stacks) to reset the damage he takes. If you're tanking Regail, just do your normal tanking rotation.
* **Elder Asani:** The other one of you will need to tank Elder Asani. Her **Tidal Wave** ability will push you back, so position yourselves near a wall to avoid getting knocked into the water and taking extra damage.
* **Taunt Swapping:** You will need to coordinate with each other to manage the boss's stacks. Communicate with each other and taunt swap when necessary.

### **Healers**

#### **Staceyxoxoxo (Mistweaver Monk) and Ennk (Discipline Priest)**

* **Elder Regail:** Focus on healing the tank on Elder Regail, especially when his stacks of **Calamity** are high.
* **Elder Asani:** Be prepared to heal the raid when she casts **Tidal Wave** and **Tainted Water**, as these abilities will deal significant damage to the raid.
* **Elder Tsulong:** Tsulong will provide a healing buff to the raid when you stand in his light. Do not leave the light. It is your main job to keep everyone topped up and focused on avoiding the damage from the other two bosses.

### **Melee DPS**

#### **StabyStabby (Assassination Rogue) and Danifaye (Arms Warrior)**

* **Elder Regail:** Focus on Elder Regail first. This is a simple tank-and-spank fight, so just use your normal rotation to deal as much damage as you can.
* **Elder Tsulong:** Once Regail is down, move to Tsulong and burn him down as quickly as possible. Tsulong has a raid-wide AoE called **Twilight Burst** that will deal heavy damage to the entire raid if you're not standing in his light.
* **Stand in the Light:** Do not leave the light that Tsulong emits. If you're not in the light, you will take heavy damage and will likely die.

### **Ranged DPS**

#### **Shootinguatm (Beast Master Hunter), Zurk (Survival Hunter), Blonker (Survival Hunter), and Scumlyfe (Affliction Warlock)**

* **Elder Regail:** All ranged DPS should focus on Elder Regail first. This is a simple tank-and-spank fight, so just use your normal rotation to deal as much damage as you can.
* **Elder Tsulong:** Once Regail is down, move to Tsulong and burn him down as quickly as possible. Tsulong has a raid-wide AoE called **Twilight Burst** that will deal heavy damage to the entire raid if you're not standing in his light.
* **Stand in the Light:** Do not leave the light that Tsulong emits. If you're not in the light, you will take heavy damage and will likely die.

Good luck and have fun!
