### **Overview**

The Tsulong fight is a two-phase encounter that alternates between a "Night" phase where you damage him, and a "Day" phase where you heal him. The fight ends when you either reduce his health to 0% during a Night phase or heal him to 100% during a Day phase. Each phase lasts for exactly two minutes.

### **Tanks**

#### **Cmdrboxhead (Blood Death Knight) and Anziano (Guardian Druid)**

* **Night Phase:** You are the main line of defense. Tsulong casts **Shadow Breath**, a frontal cone attack that deals massive Shadow damage and applies a debuff that increases Shadow damage taken.
* **Tank Swap:** You must coordinate a tank swap after each **Shadow Breath**. The tank who just took the breath should move behind the boss to let the debuff drop off. The other tank should immediately taunt and take the next breath.
* **Positioning:** Always keep Tsulong faced away from the raid to prevent **Shadow Breath** from hitting anyone else.
* **Dread Shadows:** Tsulong will apply a stacking debuff called **Dread Shadows** to the entire raid, including you. When a **Sunbeam** appears, one of you should quickly step into it to cleanse your stacks. Coordinate with the other tank so you don't both clear stacks at the same time.

* **Day Phase:** Tsulong becomes friendly, and his focus shifts to adds.
* **Embodied Terror:** One of you needs to pick up and tank the **Embodied Terror** add when it spawns.
* **Positioning:** Position the **Embodied Terror** about 20 yards in front of Tsulong, facing it away from the raid. Tsulong's **Sun Breath** will hit the add and help kill it.
* **Add Management:** Once the **Embodied Terror** dies, it will split into five **Fright Spawns**. You and your other tank need to quickly pick these up. They cast a fear, so try to tank them away from the raid if possible.

### **Healers**

#### **Staceyxoxoxo (Mistweaver Monk) and Ennk (Discipline Priest)**

* **Night Phase:** This is a high-damage phase.
* **Dread Shadows:** Your primary responsibility is to keep the raid alive from the stacking **Dread Shadows** damage over time.
* **Sunbeams:** Coordinate with the raid to enter the **Sunbeams** to clear your **Dread Shadows** stacks. Only a few people can use a single sunbeam, so don't all run in at once.
* **Tank Healing:** Be ready with strong single-target heals and cooldowns for the tank taking **Shadow Breath**. The debuff from the breath makes them extremely vulnerable to **Dread Shadows**.
* **Nightmares:** Be ready to dispel the fear from **Nightmares** if a ranged player gets caught in the circle.

* **Day Phase:** Your entire focus is on healing Tsulong.
* **Healing Tsulong:** This is a "Heal Check" phase. Use all your big healing cooldowns on Tsulong to get his health to 100% as quickly as possible.
* **Bathed in Light:** Position yourselves in front of Tsulong to receive the **Bathed in Light** buff, which greatly increases your healing done.
* **Raid Healing:** Keep an eye on the raid's health, as adds will still be dealing some damage, but your main focus is on Tsulong.

### **Melee DPS**

#### **StabyStabby (Assassination Rogue) and Danifaye (Arms Warrior)**

* **Night Phase:** This is your main damage window.
* **Damage Rotation:** Use your normal single-target rotation on Tsulong.
* **Dread Shadows:** When a **Sunbeam** appears, step into it to clear your **Dread Shadows** stacks. Be quick and efficient so the next group can use it.
* **Positioning:** Always stay behind Tsulong to avoid **Shadow Breath**.
* **Adds:** There are no specific adds for you to focus on during this phase, but if you have a cleave or AoE rotation that can hit adds without sacrificing boss damage, feel free to use it.

* **Day Phase:** Your job is to kill adds.
* **Unstable Sha:** **Unstable Sha** adds will spawn and move toward Tsulong. They must be killed before they reach him, as they will deal massive damage and fear the raid. Prioritize these adds.
* **Embodied Terrors:** Focus on the **Embodied Terror** to help the tanks kill it. Once it dies, switch to the **Fright Spawns** it leaves behind.
* **Fright Spawns:** Kill the **Fright Spawns** quickly. They can cast a fear on the raid, so eliminate them as soon as possible.

### **Ranged DPS**

#### **Shootinguatm (Beast Master Hunter), Zurk (Survival Hunter), Blonker (Survival Hunter), and Scumlyfe (Affliction Warlock)**

* **Night Phase:** This is your main damage window.
* **Damage Rotation:** Focus all your damage on Tsulong. Use your normal single-target rotation.
* **Dread Shadows:** When a **Sunbeam** appears, step into it to clear your **Dread Shadows** stacks. Spread out and do this in an orderly fashion to avoid wasting the beam.
* **Nightmares:** **Nightmares** will target a few of you and place a purple circle on the ground. Move out of the circle immediately to avoid the high damage and fear.
* **Adds:** There are no specific adds for you to focus on during this phase, but if you have a cleave or AoE rotation that can hit adds without sacrificing boss damage, feel free to use it.

* **Day Phase:** Your job is to kill adds.
* **Unstable Sha:** **Unstable Sha** adds will spawn and move toward Tsulong. They must be killed before they reach him, as they will deal massive damage and fear the raid. Prioritize these adds.
* **Embodied Terrors:** Help the tanks kill the **Embodied Terror**. Once it dies, switch to the **Fright Spawns** it leaves behind.
* **Fright Spawns:** Kill the **Fright Spawns** quickly. They can cast a fear on the raid, so eliminate them as soon as possible.
