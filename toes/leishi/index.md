### **Overview**

The Lei Shi fight is a single-phase encounter with three key mechanics that repeat at different points in the fight. The raid will need to manage a stacking debuff, a pushback phase, and a phase where Lei Shi becomes immune and spawns adds.

***

### **Tanks**

#### **Cmdrboxhead (Blood Death Knight) and Anziano (Guardian Druid)**

* **Tank Swapping:** Lei Shi's primary attack, **Spray**, is not a melee attack. It deals Frost damage and applies a stacking debuff that increases Frost damage taken. You will need to tank swap at around 8-10 stacks of this debuff to prevent the damage from becoming unmanageable.
* **Positioning:** **Spray** has a small splash damage effect, so you must be positioned at least 3.5 yards away from other raid members.
* **Animated Protectors:** At 80%, 60%, 40%, and 20% health, Lei Shi will become immune to damage and spawn **Animated Protector** adds. One of you needs to pick up these adds immediately.
* **Crowd Control:** The adds hit very hard, but are susceptible to crowd control. The raid will focus on killing one of the adds, so you should use your crowd control abilities on the other adds to minimize damage.

***

### **Healers**

#### **Staceyxoxoxo (Mistweaver Monk) and Ennk (Discipline Priest)**

* **Tank Healing:** Your primary job is to keep the tanks alive. The tank taking **Spray** will take increasing damage, so be ready with single-target cooldowns and strong heals, especially when their debuff stacks are high.
* **Get Away!:** When Lei Shi begins channeling **Get Away!**, she will deal damage and push the entire raid away. Your healing will need to be strong to keep everyone topped off, as the pushback and damage can be a dangerous combination.
* **Animated Protectors:** The **Animated Protectors** that spawn will deal high damage to the tanks. Use your cooldowns to help your tanks survive this phase.

***

### **Melee DPS**

#### **StabyStabby (Assassination Rogue) and Danifaye (Arms Warrior)**

* **Get Away!:** When Lei Shi casts **Get Away!**, she will push you away. Your job is to fight against the current and use your movement abilities (such as **Sprint** or **Heroic Leap**) to stay in melee range and continue damaging her. This phase will end once you deal enough damage to her.
* **Animated Protectors:** When Lei Shi shields herself and spawns adds, you will need to quickly switch to the marked **Animated Protector** and burst it down. Killing one add will cause Lei Shi's shield to drop and the other adds to despawn.
* **Hide:** When Lei Shi casts **Hide**, she will become invisible. You will need to use any multi-target or area-of-effect abilities you have to try and hit her to make her reappear. This is a "find the boss" mini-game.

***

### **Ranged DPS**

#### **Shootinguatm (Beast Master Hunter), Zurk (Survival Hunter), Blonker (Survival Hunter), and Scumlyfe (Affliction Warlock)**

* **Get Away!:** When Lei Shi casts **Get Away!**, she will push you away. Your job is to continue dealing damage to her, as this phase will end once you deal enough damage. Use any instant-cast abilities you have while moving.
* **Animated Protectors:** When Lei Shi shields herself and spawns adds, you will need to quickly switch to the marked **Animated Protector** and burst it down. Killing one add will cause Lei Shi's shield to drop and the other adds to despawn.
* **Hide:** When Lei Shi casts **Hide**, she will become invisible. You need to use your area-of-effect abilities to hit her and make her reappear. Spread out your AoE so you can cover more ground and find her quickly.

Good luck, and I'll be sure to get it right this time!
