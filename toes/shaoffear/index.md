### **Overview**

The Sha of Fear fight is a single-phase encounter where you will be fighting on a large circular platform. The raid needs to manage several mechanics simultaneously, including a "Wall of Light" mechanic, adds that spawn, and avoiding various abilities from the boss.

***

### **Tanks**

#### **Cmdrboxhead (Blood Death Knight) and Anziano (Guardian Druid)**

* **Wall of Light:** One tank should position themselves in the golden circle on the floor to create a **Wall of Light**. This wall protects the raid from the boss's **Breath of Fear** ability. You must stay within this circle at all times to maintain the wall.
* **Tank Swapping:** The boss's melee attacks apply a debuff called **Naked and Afraid**, which reduces your armor, dodge, and parry. You should taunt swap with the other tank when your stacks get too high to avoid taking too much damage.
* **Breath of Fear:** When the boss's energy bar reaches 30, he will cast **Breath of Fear**. Anyone not inside the **Wall of Light** will be feared and take massive damage. Make sure the raid is inside the wall before this cast goes off.
* **Adds:** When **Terror Spawns** and **Dread Spawns** appear, you should pick them up quickly.

### **Healers**

#### **Staceyxoxoxo (Mistweaver Monk) and Ennk (Discipline Priest)**

* **Heal the Raid:** The boss will be casting **Eerie Skull** and **Huddle in Terror**, which deal high raid-wide damage. Be prepared to use your cooldowns to keep the raid topped off.
* **Dispels:** **Huddle in Terror** will horrify players, so be ready to dispel it from anyone who gets caught.
* **Pure Light:** A player will be given the **Pure Light** buff, which they can pass to other players. When this buff is passed, it dispels **Huddle in Terror** and increases the damage of **Dread Spawns** for a short period of time. You will need to coordinate with your ranged DPS to pass this buff at the right time.

***

### **Melee DPS**

#### **StabyStabby (Assassination Rogue) and Danifaye (Arms Warrior)**

* **Boss Damage:** Your primary job is to deal as much damage as possible to the Sha of Fear. Stay behind the boss to avoid **Implacable Strike**.
* **Eerie Skull:** This ability will target a random player and deal damage to them and anyone within 2.5 yards. Make sure you are spread out at least 3 yards apart from other raid members.
* **Wall of Light:** When **Breath of Fear** is about to be cast, you must move into the **Wall of Light** to avoid being feared and killed.

***

### **Ranged DPS**

#### **Shootinguatm (Beast Master Hunter), Zurk (Survival Hunter), Blonker (Survival Hunter), and Scumlyfe (Affliction Warlock)**

* **Adds:** When **Terror Spawns** and **Dread Spawns** appear, your main job is to kill them as quickly as possible.
* **Pure Light:** The **Pure Light** buff will be passed to a ranged DPS player. This player should then stand in the middle of the room to group up the **Dread Spawns** so your team can AoE them down.
* **Movement:** The adds will cast **Penetrating Bolt**, which will travel from the add to a random raid member. You need to constantly be on the move to avoid getting hit by these bolts.
* **Wall of Light:** When **Breath of Fear** is about to be cast, you must move into the **Wall of Light** to avoid being feared and killed.
