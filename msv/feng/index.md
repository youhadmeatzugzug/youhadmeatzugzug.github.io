## Feng the Accursed – Heroic 10-Man

This fight cycles through **three phases** with unique mechanics: *Spirit of the Fist*, *Spirit of the Spear*, and *Spirit of the Staff*. On heroic, you’ll also deal with *Epicenter*, *Arcane Resonance*, and *Wildfire Spark* with higher damage and stricter coordination.

---

### Tanks – Cmdrboxhead (Blood DK) & Anziano (Guardian Druid)

* **Tank swap** at 2 stacks of the current phase’s debuff (Lightning Lash, Flaming Spear, Arcane Shock).
* One tank uses **Nullification Barrier** to soak Epicenter or Arcane Velocity damage as needed.
* Position boss near the center for easy movement during mechanics.
* In *Spirit of the Spear*, face boss away from raid to avoid cleaving.

### Healers – Staceyxoxoxo (Mistweaver), Ennk (Disc Priest)

* Assign cooldowns:

  * **Epicenter**: Barrier or Revival with Nullification Barrier.
  * **Arcane Velocity**: Stack and use Spirit Shell / Revival.
  * **Wildfire Spark**: Dispel quickly when the player is isolated.
* Keep movement heals ready for constant repositioning.
* Prioritize topping targets with Arcane Resonance.

### Melee DPS – StabyStabby (Assassination), Danifaye (Arms)

* Stay behind boss unless moving for mechanics.
* Swap to Wildfire Spark targets if adds spawn (depending on strat).
* Use Cloak of Shadows / Die by the Sword for Epicenter damage when not covered by Nullification Barrier.

### Ranged DPS – Hunters (Shootinguatm & Zurk)

* Spread when Arcane Resonance is active.
* High mobility makes you ideal for baiting Wildfire Sparks away from the group.
* Use Deterrence to soak damage if caught in an Epicenter.

### Arcane Mage – Blonker

* Maintain max range when Arcane Resonance is on you to minimize splash.
* Blink to quickly drop Wildfire Sparks far from raid.
* Burn phases align well after Epicenter when boss is stationary.

### Destruction Warlock – Scumlyfe

* Keep DoTs up through movement phases.
* Use Demonic Circle to quickly reposition after dropping Wildfire Sparks.
* Unending Resolve for soaking if needed.

**Key Heroic Tips**

1. **Nullification Barrier Timing** – coordinate between tanks to cover every Epicenter or Arcane Velocity.
2. **Wildfire Sparks** – assigned ranged drop them in pre-determined safe zones.
3. **Arcane Resonance** – afflicted player moves far from others immediately.
4. **Healer CD Rotation** – pre-plan for each major AoE event.

**Priority Assignments**

* Wildfire Spark soakers: Hunters primary, Mage backup.
* Nullification Barrier calls: Main tank calls out before use.
* Healer CDs: Pre-assigned per phase for smooth rotation.
