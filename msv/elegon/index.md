## Elegon – Heroic 10-Man

This fight focuses on managing **Energy Charges**, controlling add waves, and maximizing damage on the boss during **Draw Power** while handling massive raid damage.

---

### Tanks – Cmdrboxhead (Blood DK) & Anziano (Guardian Druid)

* Swap at 2–3 stacks of **Overcharged** to manage damage.
* Stay in the energy platform zone to maintain damage buff when possible.
* Pick up Celestial Protectors quickly; position them inside the platform until they’re about to die, then move them out to drop the **Explosion** safely.
* Use major cooldowns during high **Overcharged** stacks or Protector explosions.

### Healers – Staceyxoxoxo (Mistweaver), Ennk (Disc Priest)

* Heavy damage during **Draw Power** and **Final Phase**; plan cooldowns.
* Assign one healer to focus tanks, one for raid during Protector explosions.
* Step out of the energy platform briefly to drop your **Overcharged** stacks if needed.
* Be ready for burst healing when Energy Charges are missed.

### Melee DPS – StabyStabby (Assassination), Danifaye (Arms)

* Focus Celestial Protector when it’s up.
* During **Draw Power**, switch to Energy Charges quickly; prioritize killing them before they reach the edge.
* Stay in the platform zone for the buff as much as possible.
* Avoid standing in Protector explosions.

### Ranged DPS – Hunters (Shootinguatm & Zurk)

* Excellent for Energy Charge duty during **Draw Power**.
* Split sides for orb coverage; coordinate cooldowns for later waves.
* Maintain uptime on boss during Protector downtime.
* Handle ranged positioning for Sparks in the final phase.

### Arcane Mage – Blonker

* Strong burst for Energy Charges; use cooldowns for high orb waves.
* Maintain platform buff for maximum DPS.
* Avoid excessive movement—Blink to stay in range.
* Assist on Sparks in final phase.

### Destruction Warlock – Scumlyfe

* Multidot Protectors and boss.
* Use Havoc to maximize orb damage in **Draw Power**.
* Gateway can help reposition in final phase.
* Plan cooldowns for burn phase.

**Key Heroic Tips**

1. **Draw Power Management** – Pre-assign orb kill order and positions.
2. **Protector Explosion Control** – Tanks move them out before death.
3. **Final Phase Burn** – Stack, heal through massive raid damage, and use all cooldowns.
4. **Stack Buff Maximization** – Stay on platform as long as possible without dying.

**Priority Assignments**

* Orb Teams: Split evenly with coverage for late-wave speed kills.
* Cooldown Rotations: Plan for Draw Power waves 4–6 and final phase.
* Tank Swaps: At 2–3 stacks of Overcharged consistently.
