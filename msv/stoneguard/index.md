## Stone Guard – Heroic 10-Man (Stack Method)

You’ll be stacking all three Guardians together to maximize cleave and simplify positioning. Tile painting is still critical — Energized Tiles give your group a big DPS boost.

---

### Tanks – Cmdrboxhead (Blood DK) & Anziano (Guardian Druid)

* Stack all three Guardians together.
* Swap the *petrifying* Guardian between tanks so energy gain is spread evenly — this avoids multiple Guardians overloading at the same time.
* Use big CDs (IBF, Barkskin, Survival Instincts) during Overloads.
* Keep boss movement minimal to reduce DPS downtime.

### Healers – Staceyxoxoxo (Mistweaver), Ennk (Disc Priest)

* Plan raid cooldowns for each Overload: Barrier, Revival, Spirit Shell.
* Pre-shield/HoT the raid before Overloads.
* One healer should be ready to click crystals if a DPS is mid-cast or out of position.

### Melee DPS – StabyStabby (Assassination), Danifaye (Arms)

* Stay on bosses for cleave uptime.
* Use personal defensives (Cloak, Die by the Sword, Rallying Cry) for Overloads.
* Only assist tile painting if hunters/mage can’t cover.

### Ranged DPS – Hunters (Shootinguatm & Zurk)

* **Primary tile painters**: grab Living Crystals at pull, 75%, and 40%.
* Keep DPS on bosses between crystal runs.
* Use Deterrence to cross hazards safely.

### Arcane Mage – Blonker

* **Backup tile painter**: only cover tiles if a hunter is locked in movement or hazard. You benefit more from uptime due to stationary burn phases.
* Use Blink for hazard crossing, Ice Block for emergency survival.
* Time Arcane Power + cooldowns right after an Overload to maximize damage when healers are stable.

### Destruction Warlock – Scumlyfe

* Keep Immolate/Conflagrate uptime on all Guardians.
* Use Shadowburn during execute phases to funnel DPS.
* Healthstone and Unending Resolve for Overloads.
* Not a primary tile painter — focus on DPS uptime.

**Close Overload Survival**

1. Stagger tank swaps to delay double Overloads.
2. Rotate healer CDs per Overload.
3. Use personal defensives every Overload.
4. Healers top everyone before Overload hits.

---

**Tile Coverage Priority**

1. Shootinguatm
2. Zurk
3. Blonker (only if needed)
4. Melee fill-in as last resort

---

## Survival Strategy for Close Overloads

1. **Prevent Overlaps** with tank swaps and energy control.
2. **Stack Healer Coverage**: Keep the raid tight and AoE-healer focused.
3. **Cooldown Rotation**:

   * **First Overload**: Barrier (Priest), Revival (Monk)
   * **Second Overload**: Tranquility or tank CD + raid defensives
4. **Personal Cooldowns**: Everyone uses their class defensives—mage pops Ice Block, hunters Deterrence, rogue Cloak, etc.
5. **Healers Pre-Fill**: Healers prep shields or HoTs just before Overload and follow up between hits.
