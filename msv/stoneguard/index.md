## Strategy Refresher (Heroic – Stack Method with Tiles)

You're going full stack: all three Guardians grouped together to maximize cleave DPS and simplify healer/tank positioning. Your Hunters (Shootinguatm, Zurk, Blonker) and now your Arcane Mage (Blonker) are prime candidates to handle the tile painting mechanic for the **Energized Tiles** buff—critical in Heroic mode. Clicking the Living Crystals at pull, 75%, and 40% energizes floor tiles, granting 1% Damage & Spirit per tile for your raid stack ([Method](https://www.method.gg/mop-classic/the-stone-guard-boss-guide-mogushan-vaults-mop-classic?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Icy Veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/mists-of-pandaria-classic/the-stone-guard-encounter-guide-strategy-abilities-loot?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

## Role-by-Role Breakdown

### **Tanks** – Cmdrboxhead (Blood DK) & Anziano (Guardian Druid)

* Stack all three Guardians tightly and manage energy.
* Use tank aggro swaps to ensure the petrifying Guardian reaches Overload first ([Method](https://www.method.gg/mop-classic/the-stone-guard-boss-guide-mogushan-vaults-mop-classic?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Icy Veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/mists-of-pandaria-classic/the-stone-guard-encounter-guide-strategy-abilities-loot?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
* Use major tank cooldowns (e.g., Vampiric Blood, Barkskin) to ride through Overloads.
* Spread slightly only if environmental mechanics (mines, pools) force it.

### **Healers** – Staceyxoxoxo (Mistweaver Monk) & Ennk (Disc Priest)

* Line up raid-wide cooldowns (Barrier, Revival, etc.) for Overload hits (\~1.5M damage each) ([Icy Veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/mists-of-pandaria-classic/the-stone-guard-encounter-guide-strategy-abilities-loot?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Method](https://www.method.gg/mop-classic/the-stone-guard-boss-guide-mogushan-vaults-mop-classic?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
* One healer should be mobile to click crystals and paint tiles.
* Between Overloads, use big healing bursts (Renewing Mist + Uplift or Penance + Flash Heal).

### **Melee DPS** – StabyStabby (Rogue), Danifaye (Arms Warrior)

* Maintain cleave uptime on stacked Guardians.
* Use defensive CDs during Overloads (Cloak of Shadows, Rallying Cry).
* Help with tile painting if extra coverage is needed.

### **Hunters (Ranged DPS)** – Shootinguatm, Zurk (Survival), and Blonker (sorry, that's now Mage)—but originally three hunters

* Primary tile painters: click crystals and run tiles for Energized buff at pull, 75%, and 40% ([Method](https://www.method.gg/mop-classic/the-stone-guard-boss-guide-mogushan-vaults-mop-classic?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [MMOJUGG](https://www.mmojugg.com/news/stone-guard-boss-guide-for-wow-mop-classic.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
* Maintain DPS when not painting; use Deterrence or other defensives to cross hazardous zones safely.

### **Arcane Mage** – Blonker (updated!)

* **Tile Painting**: Arcane Mage mobility (Blink, Slow Fall) makes you a fantastic tile painter—grab a tile rotation at pull, 75%, 40%!
* **Burst DPS**: With Evocation/Arcane Power, you’re ideal for nuking off Guardians quickly before energy spirals.
* **Damage Control**: Use **Ice Block** if caught in a hazardous zone (Amethyst Pools or Cobalt Mines) without the matching Petrification or cooldowns.

### **Ranged DPS – Warlock** – Scumlyfe (Affliction)

* Spread and refresh DoTs across all Guardians for steady cleave.
* Use **Unending Resolve** or Healthstones in emergencies during Overload phases.
* Can assist tile painting if needed—but prioritize DoTs if mage and hunters cover tiles.

## Survival Strategy for Close Overloads

1. **Prevent Overlaps** with tank swaps and energy control.
2. **Stack Healer Coverage**: Keep the raid tight and AoE-healer focused.
3. **Cooldown Rotation**:

   * **First Overload**: Barrier (Priest), Revival (Monk)
   * **Second Overload**: Tranquility or tank CD + raid defensives
4. **Personal Cooldowns**: Everyone uses their class defensives—mage pops Ice Block, hunters Deterrence, rogue Cloak, etc.
5. **Healers Pre-Fill**: Healers prep shields or HoTs just before Overload and follow up between hits.

In **Heroic Stone Guard** 10-man, “close Overloads” means **two (or all three) Guardians hitting 100 Energy within a few seconds of each other** — which is the main *raid killer* if it’s not handled perfectly.

Here’s exactly how you survive it:

---

## **1. Prevent It If Possible**

* **Tank energy control** (the swapping we just discussed) is your *first line of defense*.

  * The aim is to have at least **6–8 seconds** between Overloads — long enough for healers to top people back up.
  * If two Overloads are *guaranteed* to be close, make sure the **first one** is the *petrifying Guardian*, so you have the 90% damage reduction for the highest hit.

---

## **2. Stack the Raid for Healing**

* On Heroic, healers need everyone **within range of AoE heals** for rapid recovery between hits.
* Don’t spread unless a mechanic (mines, chains) *forces* you — and even then, collapse again before Overload.

---

## **3. Rotate Raid-Wide Defensive Cooldowns**

You’ve got **two healers**, so external CDs are limited — but DPS/tanks can cover the gaps:

**First Overload:**

* Disc Priest: **Power Word: Barrier**
* Mistweaver Monk: **Revival** if needed, or ramp with Renewing Mist / Uplift before impact.

**Second Overload (if close):**

* Blood DK: **Anti-Magic Zone** (if talented) or Vampiric Blood for group healing boost.
* Guardian Druid: **Tranquility** right after impact.

**Other tools for any close pair of Overloads:**

* Hunters: **Aspect of the Turtle** (Deterrence) — halves damage for themselves.
* Rogue: **Feint + Elusiveness** (huge AoE damage reduction) or **Cloak** if the damage type matches.
* Warrior: **Rallying Cry** before impact.
* Warlock: **Unending Resolve** (self) and **Healthstones** raid-wide.

---

## **4. Personal Cooldowns Are Mandatory**

Tell your DPS they *must* use personals during close Overloads. This means:

* **Healthstones** before the second hit.
* **Class defensives** even if they “think they don’t need it” — because the second hit will land while the raid is already at \~50–70% HP.

---

## **5. Healing Plan Between Hits**

* **Disc Priest**: Shields *before* the first Overload, then Penance/Flash Heal key targets before the second.
* **Mistweaver**: Use *Renewing Mist* spread, then *Uplift* / *Revival* between Overloads to top fast.

---

## **6. If It’s 3 Overloads Back-to-Back**

This is rare but can happen if energy control fails badly. The only way you live is:

1. **First Overload** — Raid-wide big cooldown.
2. **Second Overload (3–5s later)** — All personals + Healthstones.
3. **Third Overload** — Immunities / anything left (Deterrence, Cloak, Ice Block if you had a mage, etc.).
4. **Pray the boss dies** before healers go OOM.

---

### **Golden Rule**

> On Heroic, **you don’t “heal through” close Overloads** without layering cooldowns. If you don’t pre-plan who uses what for each Overload, it’s a wipe in \~2 seconds.

---

If you want, I can build you a **raid cooldown rotation chart** for your *exact group* so every Overload is covered — that’s what most guilds use for Heroic Stone Guard so they survive even sloppy overlaps.
Do you want me to map that out for your comp?
