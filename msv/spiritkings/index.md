## The Spirit Kings – Heroic 10-Man

This is a four-boss encounter with random order: **Qiang the Merciless**, **Subetai the Swift**, **Meng the Demented**, and **Zian of the Endless Shadow**. Only one is active at a time, but previous bosses leave abilities behind.

---

### Tanks – Cmdrboxhead (Blood DK) & Anziano (Guardian Druid)

* **Tank swap** on each new king as threat resets.
* Position bosses away from residual abilities from previous kings.
* During **Qiang**, swap during **Annihilate** and use active mitigation.
* Keep bosses facing away from raid during cleaves and frontal attacks.

### Healers – Staceyxoxoxo (Mistweaver), Ennk (Disc Priest)

* Be ready for large raid damage when abilities overlap.
* Save big cooldowns for **Qiang’s Annihilate**, **Subetai’s Volley + Pinning Arrows**, and **Meng’s Maddening Shout**.
* Dispels: Remove magic effects from Zian’s shadow abilities when possible.
* Keep mobile for **Pillage** and **Volley** movement.

### Melee DPS – StabyStabby (Assassination), Danifaye (Arms)

* Stay behind the boss to avoid cleaves.
* Quickly swap to Pinning Arrows during Subetai to free pinned allies.
* During Meng, interrupt **Crazy Thought** if available.
* Avoid standing near Maddening Shout targets.

### Ranged DPS – Hunters (Shootinguatm & Zurk)

* Excellent for breaking Pinning Arrows from range.
* Spread out during Zian’s **Shadow Blast**.
* Keep DPS uptime high during movement-heavy phases.
* Handle **Volleys** and quickly resume DPS.

### Arcane Mage – Blonker

* Maintain high boss uptime, using Blink to quickly reposition after movement mechanics.
* Prioritize clearing Pinning Arrows if melee are trapped.
* Keep cooldowns ready for burn phases on new kings.

### Destruction Warlock – Scumlyfe

* Multi-dot bosses when abilities from previous kings remain.
* Use Gateway strategically to help raid reposition during **Pillage** or **Volley**.
* Save Chaos Bolt for burn phases.

**Key Heroic Tips**

1. **Know the Order** – Call out next king’s abilities so raid can pre-position.
2. **Ability Overlaps** – The danger increases as abilities stack; use defensive CDs accordingly.
3. **Add Control** – Free pinned allies instantly during Subetai.
4. **Spread & Stack** – Spread for Zian’s abilities, stack for healing during high AoE.

---

**Priority Assignments**

* Pinning Arrow Breakers: Hunters first, then Blonker.
* Interrupts: Melee focus on Meng’s casts.
* Defensive CDs: Tanks for Qiang’s Annihilate, raid CDs for overlaps.
