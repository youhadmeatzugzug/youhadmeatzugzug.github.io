## Gara'jal the Spiritbinder – Heroic 10-Man

This fight revolves around sending players into the **Spirit Realm** to kill adds and heal totems while managing **Voodoo Doll** damage and surviving the **enrage timer**.

---

### Tanks – Cmdrboxhead (Blood DK) & Anziano (Guardian Druid)

* One tank on boss, the other swaps in when **Voodoo Dolls** is applied (tanks take shared damage with linked players).
* Swap every Voodoo Dolls application or when your debuff expires.
* Tanks entering Spirit Realm should help DPS Severer of Souls.
* Use personal cooldowns during Voodoo Dolls + Shadowy Attacks overlap.

### Healers – Staceyxoxoxo (Mistweaver), Ennk (Disc Priest)

* One healer always remains outside for Voodoo Dolls healing.
* The other healer enters Spirit Realm with a DPS group to top them up.
* Dispel **Spiritual Innervation** buffs only after exiting Spirit Realm.
* Coordinate healing cooldowns for heavy Voodoo Doll phases.

### Melee DPS – StabyStabby (Assassination), Danifaye (Arms)

* High burst inside Spirit Realm to kill Severer of Souls quickly.
* When outside, focus boss DPS and avoid unnecessary movement.
* Rotate entering Spirit Realm so one melee is in every group.

### Ranged DPS – Hunters (Shootinguatm & Zurk)

* High mobility makes you strong Spirit Realm candidates.
* Use burst cooldowns inside to kill adds fast.
* Outside, maintain max uptime on boss.

### Arcane Mage – Blonker

* Primarily outside for sustained boss damage.
* Backup Spirit Realm entry if a ranged dies.
* Use Blink to quickly re-engage after returning.

### Destruction Warlock – Scumlyfe

* Ideal for Spirit Realm due to strong multidotting.
* Use Demonic Circle outside to avoid movement loss.
* Save big cooldowns for Spirit Realm Severer burn.

**Key Heroic Tips**

1. **Spirit Realm Rotation** – Pre-assign 2 DPS + 1 Healer per totem wave.
2. **Enrage Management** – Heroism/Bloodlust on pull for maximum uptime.
3. **Voodoo Dolls Healing** – Keep all linked targets topped to survive overlaps.
4. **Add Kill Speed** – Faster Severer kills mean less raid-wide damage.

---

**Priority Assignments**

* Spirit Realm Groups: Melee + Hunter + Assigned Healer rotate.
* Outside Healer: Always the one not assigned to that wave.
* Defensive CDs: Tanks and Dolls targets use personals during overlaps.
