## Will of the Emperor – Heroic 10-Man

This fight revolves around add control, avoiding **Devastating Arc**, handling **Titan Gas** phases, and burning the bosses during vulnerable periods.

---

### Tanks – Cmdrboxhead (Blood DK) & Anziano (Guardian Druid)

* Each tank picks up one boss (Jan-xi and Qin-xi).
* Face bosses away from the raid.
* Step through each **Devastating Arc** swing to avoid the hit and gain the **Opportunity** buff for extra damage.
* Swap bosses at \~3 stacks of **Focused Defense** or as needed for cooldown rotation.
* Pick up Rages and Strengths if they spawn near you; kite Courages into melee.

### Healers – Staceyxoxoxo (Mistweaver), Ennk (Disc Priest)

* Tank damage is steady but spikes if they miss **Devastating Arc**.
* Raid damage is high during **Titan Gas**; plan cooldowns here.
* Be mobile—ranged add mechanics and Titan Gas will force repositioning.
* Use externals on tanks if a swing is about to hit them during Titan Gas.

### Melee DPS – StabyStabby (Assassination), Danifaye (Arms)

* Priority: Courages > Strengths > Rages > Boss.
* Help kite Rages by slowing them.
* Avoid **Devastating Arc** patterns when near bosses.
* During **Opportunity** windows, burn the boss hard.

### Ranged DPS – Hunters (Shootinguatm & Zurk)

* Primary control on Rages; slow, kite, and kill quickly.
* Switch to Courages immediately; stay spread to avoid cleave.
* During Titan Gas, maintain ranged DPS on bosses if adds are under control.

### Arcane Mage – Blonker

* Assist hunters on Rages with slows/roots.
* Burn Courages as soon as they appear.
* Use mobility tools to maintain DPS while dodging.
* Focus bosses during **Opportunity** for max burst.

### Destruction Warlock – Scumlyfe

* Multidot Rages and bosses.
* Shadowfury or Mortal Coil to help control Rages.
* Save big cooldowns for **Opportunity** windows and Titan Gas burns.

**Key Heroic Tips**

1. **Add Control Wins the Fight** – Killing adds fast keeps the fight stable.
2. **Avoid Devastating Arc** – Missing this is lethal; it also denies free damage buffs.
3. **Titan Gas Phases** – Stack healing cooldowns here and burn bosses.
4. **Opportunity Windows** – Every dodge is a DPS gift—use them.
