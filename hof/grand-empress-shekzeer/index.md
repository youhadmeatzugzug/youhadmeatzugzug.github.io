This fight has three distinct phases, with Phase 1 and 2 alternating until the boss reaches 30% health, at which point Phase 3 begins. This is a very complex fight, so communication and execution are key.

### **Phase 1: A Perilous Battle**

In this phase, you fight Grand Empress Shek'zeer directly.

### **Tanks (Cmdrboxhead & Anziano)**

* **Cmdrboxhead & Anziano (Tanks):** Your primary job is to tank swap on Shek'zeer.
    * **Eyes of the Empress:** Shek'zeer's melee attacks apply a stacking debuff called **Eyes of the Empress**. If a tank reaches 5 stacks, they will be mind-controlled and transformed into a Servant of the Empress, likely causing a wipe. You must tank swap after 2-3 stacks to avoid this.
    * **Positioning:** Tank the boss in the center of the room.
    * **Dread Screech:** Shek'zeer will target two random players with a **Dread Screech**, dealing physical damage to them and anyone within 5 yards. While you are immune to this, be aware of where it lands to help your raid avoid it.
    * **Dissonance Field:** When two **Dissonance Fields** spawn, you will need to keep the boss near one of them to help with the mechanic.

### **Healers (Staceyxoxoxo & Ennk)**

* **Raid Healing:** Phase 1 is a healing-intensive phase with constant raid damage.
* **Eyes of the Empress:** Be ready to burst heal the tank after a tank swap, as they will be taking heavy damage.
* **Dissonance Field & Cry of Terror (Critical Mechanic):**
    * **Dissonance Fields:** Two fields will spawn that have a health pool. They can only be damaged by spells cast inside of them. When a field dies, it explodes with **Sonic Discharge**, dealing massive raid-wide physical damage. If both fields die at the same time, it is almost a guaranteed wipe.
    * **Cry of Terror:** Shek'zeer will cast **Cry of Terror** on a random caster or healer. This debuff deals continuous damage to the entire raid. The player with the debuff must immediately move inside one of the **Dissonance Fields** to stop the raid damage.
    * **Coordination:** The player with the **Cry of Terror** debuff cannot be healed while inside the field. They must use a defensive cooldown to survive. The raid needs to prioritize killing one field while the other is left alone. The player with the debuff should go into the field you want to die first.
    * **Dispels:** The **Cry of Terror** debuff also fears the target for 4 seconds when it ends, dealing damage to nearby allies. Be ready to dispel this fear as soon as it ends.

### **Melee DPS (StabyStabby & Danifaye)**

* **StabyStabby (Assassination Rogue) & Danifaye (Arms Warrior):**
    * **Primary Target:** Focus on the boss.
    * **Eyes of the Empress:** Do not stand in front of the boss to avoid the tank debuff.
    * **Dread Screech:** Stay spread out from other players to avoid splash damage from **Dread Screech**.
    * **Dissonance Field:** Your spell casts will not affect the Dissonance Fields, so you will not be able to help with this mechanic directly. You will be helping by providing bursts of damage on the boss.

### **Ranged DPS (Shootinguatm, Zurk, Blonker & Scumlyfe)**

* **Shootinguatm (Beast Master Hunter), Zurk (Survival Hunter), Blonker (Survival Hunter) & Scumlyfe (Affliction Warlock):**
    * **Primary Target:** Focus on the boss.
    * **Dissonance Field & Cry of Terror (Crucial):** This is your main job.
        * **Field Damage:** You are responsible for killing the **Dissonance Fields**. You should designate a "kill field" and a "slow field." The player with **Cry of Terror** must run into the "kill field" to help it die faster. The rest of the ranged DPS should focus their spell casts into that same field.
    * **Dread Screech:** Stay spread out from other players at all times.
    * **Phase 2 adds:** When the boss reaches 70% or after 2 minutes and 30 seconds, she will retreat and Phase 2 begins.

### **Phase 2: The Empress Retreats!**

Shek'zeer retreats, and you must fight her adds.

* **Tanks:** One tank on each **Kor'thik Reaver**. Tank them away from the raid to avoid their **Toxic Slime** frontal cone.
* **Healers & Ranged DPS:** You have two main jobs in this phase.
    * **Add Management:** The **Set'thik Windblades** will fixate on random players. You must kite these adds away from you and from the raid.
    * **Poison-Drenched Armor:** The Reavers will apply a debuff, **Poison-Drenched Armor**, to the tanks. Any player who gets close to the tank with this debuff will receive a buff that increases their damage. Ranged DPS should get close to the tank to get this buff.
    * **Sticky Resin:** The **Kor'thik Reavers** will drop **Sticky Resin** pools. You must coordinate to drop these pools in the same spot to create a large **Amber Trap**.
    * **Amber Traps:** When an **Amber Trap** is formed, it will trap the first enemy who walks into it. You want to trap a **Kor'thik Reaver** in it, which will make them take 100% more damage.

### **Phase 3: Ultimate Corruption!**

Shek'zeer's health reaches 30% and she becomes fully corrupted.

* **Raid-wide Damage:** The raid will take very high, continuous damage from **Amassing Darkness**. Healers must use their cooldowns in a rotation to keep the raid alive.
* **Eyes of the Empress:** Tanks still need to swap on the **Eyes of the Empress** stacks.
* **Visions of Demise:** The boss will cast **Visions of Demise** on 5 players. They must immediately run out of the raid before the debuff fears them. Healers should be ready to dispel the fear as soon as it happens.
* **Burn Phase:** This is the final phase and a DPS race. Use all remaining offensive cooldowns and focus the boss down as fast as possible before your healers run out of mana or the damage becomes unmanageable.

Good luck!
