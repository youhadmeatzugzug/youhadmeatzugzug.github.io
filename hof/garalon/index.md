### **Raid-wide Strategy**

Garalon is a massive boss that you do not tank conventionally. Instead, he will fixate on a single raid member, and your primary goal is to manage his fixate while everyone else focuses on damaging his legs. On Heroic difficulty, the **Dread** mechanic adds a new layer of complexity to the fixate, making it harder to manage.

### **Tanks (Cmdrboxhead & Anziano)**

* **No Tanking:** This is a fight where you do not need to hold threat on the boss. Instead, your role is to focus on a specific mechanic and help manage the adds.
* **HEROIC MODE ONLY - Tanking the Legs:** In heroic mode, you, as a tank, are the only class that can tank Garalon's legs. When you attack a leg, Garalon will turn to face you, allowing other players to attack a different leg.
* **Managing the "Crush" Ability:** When Garalon's legs are crushed, he will be stunned for 25 seconds and gain a damage vulnerability buff. This is your cue to switch to the boss and use your major damage cooldowns.

### **Healers (Staceyxoxoxo & Ennk)**

* **Raid Healing:** The raid will take sustained damage from **Pheromones** and **Furious Swipe**. Be proactive with your healing over time spells and get ready to use cooldowns during bursts of damage.
* **HEROIC MODE ONLY - Dread:** When Garalon applies **Dread** to a player, it will deal moderate damage and also apply **Fear** to everyone within 8 yards. You must be prepared to dispell the fear from the affected players as soon as possible.
* **HEROIC MODE ONLY - Tank Healing:** When a tank is fixated by Garalon, they will take very high damage. Be ready to use major healing cooldowns on the tank who is fixated to keep them alive.
* **HEROIC MODE ONLY - Pheromones:** When Garalon applies **Pheromones** to a player, it will deal damage and slow their movement speed. It will also reduce the duration of **Dread** on them by 5 seconds. This is your cue to use a personal defensive cooldown to survive the damage.

### **Melee DPS (StabyStabby & Danifaye)**

* **Attack the Legs:** Your primary focus is on damaging Garalon's legs. When a leg is crushed, you will have a short window to deal massive damage to the boss.
* **Avoid the Crush:** When Garalon is about to stomp a leg, the ground around it will begin to crack. Move away immediately to avoid being crushed, which is a one-shot ability.
* **HEROIC MODE ONLY - Dread:** If you are the target of **Dread**, you will take moderate damage and become feared. You must use a defensive cooldown to survive the damage and break the fear as soon as possible.
* **HEROIC MODE ONLY - Pheromones:** When Garalon applies **Pheromones** to a player, you must be prepared to deal with the damage and slow that comes with it.

### **Ranged DPS (Shootinguatm, Zurk, Blonker & Scumlyfe)**

* **Maintain Distance:** Stay at a distance from the boss to avoid his melee attacks.
* **Avoid the Crush:** When Garalon is about to stomp a leg, the ground around it will begin to crack. Move away immediately to avoid being crushed.
* **HEROIC MODE ONLY - Dread:** If you are the target of **Dread**, you will take moderate damage and become feared. You must use a personal defensive cooldown to survive the damage and break the fear as soon as possible.
* **HEROIC MODE ONLY - Pheromones:** When Garalon applies **Pheromones** to a player, you must be prepared to deal with the damage and slow that comes with it.
