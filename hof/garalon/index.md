Here are the instructions for your 10-man Normal difficulty raid team for the Garalon encounter in Heart of Fear.

### **Raid-wide Strategy**

Garalon is a unique fight that requires excellent positioning and movement from the entire raid. Instead of a traditional tank-and-spank, this boss must be kited, as he does not melee attack. The core mechanics revolve around managing a debuff that draws the boss, avoiding his powerful abilities, and damaging his legs to slow him down.

### **Tanks (Cmdrboxhead & Anziano)**

* **Cmdrboxhead & Anziano (Tanks):** Your primary role is to "soak" the boss's **Furious Swipe** and manage your position relative to the rest of the raid.
    * **Soaking Furious Swipe:** Garalon will regularly cast **Furious Swipe**, a frontal cone attack. This ability must hit at least two players, or the boss will gain a stacking buff that increases his damage and movement speed. Both tanks should stack together in front of Garalon to soak this ability.
    * **Positioning:** You should always be in front of the boss, with the boss's rear end facing the rest of the raid. The person kiting the boss will be pulling him around, and you need to move with him to stay in the right position for the soaks.

### **Healers (Staceyxoxoxo & Ennk)**

* **Raid Damage:** Be prepared for constant, increasing raid-wide damage from **Pheromones**. The longer the player kiting Garalon has the debuff, the more damage it deals.
* **Spot Healing:** Watch for players who are hit by **Crush** (unlikely if the raid is positioned correctly) or who have the Pheromones debuff for an extended period.
* **Specific Duties:**
    * **Pheromone Management:** The **Pheromones** debuff will randomly target a ranged player and draw Garalon to them. The raid leader will designate a couple of players to be "kiters," but as a healer, you need to be aware of who has the debuff. If a designated kiter is taking too much damage, be ready to pass the debuff.
    * **Raid Cooldowns:** Use your raid healing cooldowns like **Revival** or **Rapture** to deal with the sustained raid damage, especially if the Pheromones debuff has been on a player for a while.

### **Melee DPS (StabyStabby & Danifaye)**

* **StabyStabby (Assassination Rogue) & Danifaye (Arms Warrior):**
    * **Primary Target:** Your main focus is the boss, but you will need to frequently switch to his legs.
    * **Legs:** Garalon has four legs, which can be targeted and killed. When a leg is killed, it deals a significant amount of damage to the boss and applies a debuff that slows him down. This is crucial for keeping him kited. Focus your damage on the legs as soon as they become active.
    * **Positioning:** Stay on the sides or behind the boss. Do NOT stand directly under him. Standing under him will trigger his **Crush** ability, which deals massive raid-wide damage.
    * **Damage:** You will gain a buff called **Weak Points** when you are within 12 yards of Garalon's legs, which increases your damage to them. Use this to your advantage to burst them down quickly.

### **Ranged DPS (Shootinguatm, Zurk, Blonker & Scumlyfe)**

* **Shootinguatm (Beast Master Hunter), Zurk (Survival Hunter), Blonker (Survival Hunter) & Scumlyfe (Affliction Warlock):**
    * **Primary Target:** You have two main jobs: damaging the boss and kiting him.
    * **Kiting Pheromones:** The **Pheromones** debuff will be cast on a random ranged player. The person with this debuff becomes the "kiter."
        * **Kiting Path:** The kiter's job is to run away from Garalon to keep him at a distance. As you run, you will leave behind a green trail. If anyone crosses this trail, the Pheromones debuff will jump to them, causing Garalon to cast his **Crush** ability on the raid. The ideal path is to run in a large circle around the outside of the room to avoid trapping the rest of your raid.
        * **Debuff Swapping:** The Pheromones debuff has a stacking damage effect. When the damage becomes too high, the kiter must pass the debuff to another designated ranged player by having them run over the green trail.
    * **Legs:** Just like the melee DPS, you should also be focusing on the legs when they are up to slow the boss down and deal damage.
    * **Avoid Crush:** NEVER stand under Garalon. This will trigger **Crush** and likely wipe the raid on normal mode.

### **General Tips for Everyone**

* **Stay Out from Under the Boss:** This is the most critical rule of the fight. Do not stand under Garalon.
* **Focus Legs:** Killing the legs is the key to slowing Garalon down and winning the fight. Make them your priority.
* **Communication:** Ranged DPS should communicate who is kiting and when they are going to pass the Pheromones debuff. This ensures a smooth transition and avoids accidental debuff swaps.
* **Movement:** This fight is all about movement. Be aware of where you are in the room and where the kiter is going.
* **Normal Mode:** For a 10-man Normal group, the mechanics are straightforward. Executing the kiting correctly and burning down the legs is all you need for a successful kill.

Good luck!
