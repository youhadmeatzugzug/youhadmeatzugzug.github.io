Here are the instructions for your 10-man Normal difficulty raid team for the Amber-Shaper Un'sok encounter in Heart of Fear.

### **Raid-wide Strategy**

The fight against Amber-Shaper Un'sok is a two-phase encounter that requires careful positioning, add management, and a controlled burn. The main mechanic is managing the "Amber," which can be used to control adds or freeze the boss.

### **Phase 1: Amber-Shaper Un'sok**

The raid will start the fight by engaging Un'sok.

### **Tanks (Cmdrboxhead & Anziano)**

* **Cmdrboxhead (Main Tank):** Your primary job is to hold aggro on the boss, Amber-Shaper Un'sok.
    * **Tank Swap:** Un'sok casts **Volatile Amber**, which applies a stacking debuff on the tank that increases damage taken from this ability. You must tank swap after every 2-3 stacks to prevent the damage from becoming unmanageable.
    * **Positioning:** Tank the boss in the center of the room.
* **Anziano (Off Tank):** Your job is to tank swap and pick up the adds.
    * **Adds:** When the **Living Amber** adds spawn, you must pick them up immediately.
    * **Positioning:** You will need to move these adds into the path of the **Amber Strike** to freeze them. The ranged DPS will be calling out where the Amber Strike is going to land. Your job is to position the adds so they are hit and frozen.
    * **Frozen Adds:** Frozen adds will be shattered by a melee or ranged attack, and this action will deal a large amount of damage to the boss.

### **Healers (Staceyxoxoxo & Ennk)**

* **Raid Healing:** This fight has moderate raid-wide damage, but the tanks and the person kiting the adds will need your primary attention.
* **Tank Healing:** Focus on keeping the current tank alive, especially as their stacks of **Volatile Amber** increase.
* **Add Healing:** Be ready to heal players who are taking damage from the adds.
* **Specific Duties:**
    * **Un'sok's Abilities:** Un'sok also casts **Shattered Amber**, which will hit a random player and then explode, damaging everyone within a small radius. Keep the raid topped off to deal with this.

### **Melee DPS (StabyStabby & Danifaye)**

* **StabyStabby (Assassination Rogue) & Danifaye (Arms Warrior):**
    * **Primary Target:** Your main target is the boss.
    * **Add Damage:** You should not attack the **Living Amber** adds until they are frozen by an **Amber Strike**. Once they are frozen, hit them immediately to shatter them and deal a huge amount of damage to the boss.
    * **Un'sok's Abilities:** Avoid the **Shattered Amber** that appears on the ground.
    * **Phase 2:** When Phase 2 starts, a player will be turned into a monster. Your job is to kill this player as quickly as possible. The player who becomes the monster will need to be the designated kiter.

### **Ranged DPS (Shootinguatm, Zurk, Blonker & Scumlyfe)**

* **Shootinguatm (Beast Master Hunter), Zurk (Survival Hunter), Blonker (Survival Hunter) & Scumlyfe (Affliction Warlock):**
    * **Primary Target:** Your main focus is the boss.
    * **Add Management (Crucial):** This is your most important job.
        * **Amber Strike:** When Un'sok casts **Amber Strike**, it will target a random player and create a projectile that travels in a straight line. You must move out of the path of this projectile, and you must communicate with the off-tank to have the adds lined up so the projectile hits and freezes them.
    * **Add Damage:** Do not attack the adds unless they are frozen. Once they are frozen, you can help the melee DPS shatter them.
    * **Phase 2:** At 40% health, Un'sok will cast **Unleashed Amber**, turning a random player into a **Mutated Construct**. This is a special part of the fight.
        * **Kiting the Construct:** The player who becomes the construct will have a new action bar with three abilities. They must kite the boss and the adds around the room. They will have a slow ability and a sprint to help them.
        * **Killing the Construct:** The rest of the raid must immediately switch to and kill the **Mutated Construct** before the "Unstable Amber" debuff on the Construct becomes too high. The higher the stacks, the more damage the construct deals to the raid.

### **General Tips for Everyone**

* **Add Management:** The key to this fight is properly managing the adds and using the **Amber Strike** to freeze them. Freezing and shattering the adds is your primary source of boss damage, so get this mechanic right.
* **Phase 2:** The transition to Phase 2 is the most chaotic part of the fight. Everyone must immediately switch to the **Mutated Construct** and burn it down as quickly as possible.
* **Communication:** Ranged DPS must communicate where the **Amber Strike** is going to land so the off-tank can position the adds accordingly.
* **Normal Mode:** For a 10-man Normal group, the damage isn't as high, but the mechanics are the same. The key is to be disciplined with your add management and your Phase 2 burst.

Good luck!
