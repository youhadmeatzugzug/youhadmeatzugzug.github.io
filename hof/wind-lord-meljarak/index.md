### **Raid-wide Strategy**

The Wind Lord Mel'jarak fight is a unique encounter that combines a main boss with a group of adds. The key to this fight is managing these adds and using their abilities against each other. The boss, Mel'jarak, is protected by a shield until his adds are defeated.

### **Tanks (Cmdrboxhead & Anziano)**

* **Cmdrboxhead (Main Tank):** Your job is to tank the boss, Wind Lord Mel'jarak.
    * **Positioning:** Tank Mel'jarak in the center of the room. He will be invulnerable until all his adds are defeated, so your initial job is to hold aggro and prepare for when his shield drops.
    * **Taunt:** When Mel'jarak casts **Wind Bomb**, he will throw a bomb at a player, creating a small circle on the ground. You will need to taunt the boss and move him away from this area.
* **Anziano (Off Tank):** Your main responsibility is to manage the adds.
    * **Group the Adds:** Immediately after the fight starts, run in and pick up all four adds. Group them up tightly so the DPS can cleave and AoE them down efficiently.
    * **Interrupts:** The **Kor'thik Defector** add will cast **Tainted Weapon**. You must interrupt this cast to prevent him from dealing high damage to the raid.
    * **Add Death:** When an add dies, it will drop a **Focused Force Field** on the ground. This is a very important mechanic. You will need to strategically position the adds so their death locations are useful to the raid.

### **Healers (Staceyxoxoxo & Ennk)**

* **Raid Healing:** This fight involves consistent raid damage from the adds' abilities and Mel'jarak himself.
* **Spot Healing:** Be prepared for players taking high single-target damage from the adds or Mel'jarak's abilities.
* **Focus on Adds:** While Mel'jarak is protected, your main job is to keep the off-tank and the raid healthy as they deal with the adds.
* **Specific Duties:**
    * **Staceyxoxoxo (Mistweaver Monk) & Ennk (Disc Priest):** When an add dies, the **Focused Force Field** they drop can be used to mitigate damage. You should be in this field whenever possible, as it reduces damage taken by 90%. This is an excellent way to survive high-damage abilities, especially from the **Blade of the Imperator** casts.

### **Melee DPS (StabyStabby & Danifaye)**

* **StabyStabby (Assassination Rogue) & Danifaye (Arms Warrior):**
    * **Add Prioritization:** Your priority is to kill the adds.
    * **Focus:** Your group needs to decide on a kill order for the adds. A good general strategy is to kill the **Kor'thik Striker** first (the one that applies a bleed), then the **Kor'thik Defector** (the one that needs to be interrupted), and finally the other two.
    * **Cleave/AoE:** Since the off-tank will be grouping the adds, use your cleave and area-of-effect abilities to hit multiple targets at once.
    * **Focused Force Field:** When an add dies, a green field appears. Stand in this field when you need to be protected from a high-damage ability, like the **Blade of the Imperator** cast.
    * **Blade of the Imperator:** When Mel'jarak casts this, he will target a random player and throw a volley of blades at them. You must use the **Focused Force Field** to survive this.

### **Ranged DPS (Shootinguatm, Zurk, Blonker & Scumlyfe)**

* **Shootinguatm (Beast Master Hunter), Zurk (Survival Hunter), Blonker (Survival Hunter) & Scumlyfe (Affliction Warlock):**
    * **Add Prioritization:** Your priority is to kill the adds.
    * **Focused Force Field:** This is a crucial mechanic for ranged DPS. When the **Kor'thik Defector** dies, he will drop a field that increases the damage of anyone inside it by 50%. Your goal is to stand in this field to maximize your damage on the remaining adds and the boss when his shield drops.
    * **Wind Bomb:** Mel'jarak will throw bombs at players. You must move out of the circle on the ground to avoid taking damage.
    * **Blade of the Imperator:** This is a key ability to manage. A player will be targeted with a red arrow and a ring will appear. You must stand in a **Focused Force Field** to survive this. The person targeted should be the first to get into the field.

### **General Tips for Everyone**

* **Add Management:** The most important part of this fight is managing the adds and their death locations.
    * **Defense Field:** The **Kor'thik Defector** will drop a damage-increasing field.
    * **Offense Field:** The **Kor'thik Striker** will drop a damage-reducing field.
* **Kill Order:** The most common kill order is Striker > Defector > any other add. Killing the Striker first gives you a defensive field, then killing the Defector gives you an offensive field to burn down the rest of the adds.
* **Phase 2 (Boss):** Once all adds are dead, the boss's shield will drop. This is your cue to use all your cooldowns and burst him down. He will still cast **Blade of the Imperator**, so be ready to use the remaining **Focused Force Fields** to survive it.
* **Normal Mode:** For a 10-man group, managing the adds is straightforward. The key is to be disciplined with your add focus and to use the fields for survival and damage.

Good luck!
