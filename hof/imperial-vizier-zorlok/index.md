Here are the instructions for your 10-man Normal difficulty raid team for the Imperial Vizier Zor'lok encounter in Heart of Fear.

### **Raid-wide Strategy**

This fight is about managing adds, soaking powerful abilities, and positioning correctly. The fight has two phases: a main phase and a "Subjugated" phase. The main phase repeats, and the Subjugated phase is a special phase where the boss gains a new ability based on the platform he flies to.

### **Tanks (Cmdrboxhead & Anziano)**

* **Cmdrboxhead (Main Tank):** Your primary job is to hold aggro on the boss, Imperial Vizier Zor'lok, for the entire fight.
    * **Positioning:** Keep the boss in the center of the platform and facing away from the raid to prevent a frontal cone ability, **Blade of the Imperator**, from hitting anyone else.
    * **Interrupts:** Interrupt Zor'lok's cast of **Attenuated Blade** whenever possible. This will help reduce incoming damage.
    * **Swap:** When Zor'lok casts **Force and Verve**, you and Anziano will need to tank swap. The debuff increases your damage taken, so the off-tank should taunt to take over the boss.
* **Anziano (Off Tank):** Your main responsibility is to manage the adds and tank swap with Cmdrboxhead.
    * **Adds:** When the **Exiled from the Imperator** adds spawn, grab them immediately. They will fixate on a random player, so you need to taunt them off that player and tank them. These adds should be killed quickly by the DPS.
    * **Tank Swap:** Taunt Zor'lok from Cmdrboxhead when he casts **Force and Verve**.
    * **Damage:** Don't forget to contribute to boss damage when you're not actively tanking or managing adds.

### **Healers (Staceyxoxoxo & Ennk)**

* **Raid Damage:** Be prepared for significant raid-wide damage from **Attenuated Blade**, especially if interrupts are missed. Keep everyone topped off.
* **Tank Healing:** Focus on keeping the main tank alive during **Force and Verve**. The tank with the debuff will take a lot of damage.
* **Specific Duties:**
    * **Staceyxoxoxo (Mistweaver Monk):** Use your raid cooldowns like **Revival** to help with high-damage phases. Your sustained healing is great for keeping the raid healthy.
    * **Ennk (Disc Priest):** Use your shields, like **Power Word: Shield**, to mitigate damage before it happens, particularly on players who are soaking abilities. Your raid cooldowns like **Pain Suppression** and **Rapture** are excellent for emergency situations or high-damage spikes.

### **Melee DPS (StabyStabby & Danifaye)**

* **StabyStabby (Assassination Rogue) & Danifaye (Arms Warrior):**
    * **Target:** Your primary target is the boss, Imperial Vizier Zor'lok.
    * **Interrupts:** You have the ability to interrupt with **Kick** and **Pummel**. Use these on Zor'lok's **Attenuated Blade** to help the tanks and healers.
    * **Adds:** Be ready to quickly switch to and kill the **Exiled from the Imperator** adds as soon as they spawn. They have low health and need to die quickly.
    * **Positioning:** Stand behind the boss to avoid the frontal cone ability, **Blade of the Imperator**.
    * **Avoid:** Watch your feet for green orbs and avoid standing in the **Song of the Imperator** rings.

### **Ranged DPS (Shootinguatm, Zurk, Blonker & Scumlyfe)**

* **Shootinguatm (Beast Master Hunter), Zurk (Survival Hunter), Blonker (Survival Hunter) & Scumlyfe (Affliction Warlock):**
    * **Primary Target:** Your main focus is the boss, Imperial Vizier Zor'lok.
    * **Adds:** As with the melee DPS, be prepared to quickly switch and kill the **Exiled from the Imperator** adds. Hunters can use abilities like **Misdirection** to help the off-tank with aggro on the adds.
    * **Soaking:** This is your most important job. When the boss casts **Song of the Imperator**, a green orb will form and a large green ring will spread out from it. At least one person MUST stand in the ring to soak the damage. If no one soaks, the entire raid will take massive damage. Coordinate with your team to have at least one person soak each ring.
    * **Subjugated Phase:**
        * **Subjugated Song:** The boss will fly to one of the platforms and cast a different ability.
            * **Song of the Imperator (Green Platform):** Continue soaking the rings. Ranged DPS and healers should coordinate to have at least one person in each ring.
            * **Blade of the Imperator (Purple Platform):** The boss will channel a volley of blades at a player. All ranged DPS should be grouped up, so the blades hit the entire group. This spreads the damage out and makes it manageable for the healers.
            * **Force and Verve (Red Platform):** The boss will periodically apply a damage-over-time debuff to a random player. This is a simple burn phase. Focus on dealing as much damage as possible while the healers keep everyone topped off.
    * **Avoid:** Avoid standing in the green orbs and the large green rings if you are not the designated soaker.

### **General Tips for Everyone**

* **Subjugated Phase:** When the boss flies to a platform, everyone should move to that platform as a group.
* **Interrupts:** **Attenuated Blade** is a very important cast to interrupt. The more it is interrupted, the less stress on your healers.
* **Coordination:** Communication is key, especially for soaking the **Song of the Imperator** rings. Call out who is soaking and where.
* **Normal Mode:** Remember that this is Normal mode. The mechanics are less punishing than Heroic, so a few mistakes won't necessarily wipe the raid. Stay calm, execute your roles, and you'll have this boss down quickly.

Good luck!
