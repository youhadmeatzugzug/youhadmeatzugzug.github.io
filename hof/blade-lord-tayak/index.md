Here are the instructions for your 10-man Normal difficulty raid team for the Blade Lord Ta'yak encounter in Heart of Fear.

### **Raid-wide Strategy**

This fight is a test of raid awareness and positioning. The fight consists of two phases: a main phase that repeats until the boss reaches low health, and a movement-intensive wind phase. The key is to respond correctly to the boss's abilities, which force you to either spread out or stack up.

### **Tanks (Cmdrboxhead & Anziano)**

* **Cmdrboxhead & Anziano (Tanks):** Your main responsibility is to manage the boss and the tank swap mechanic.
    * **Tank Swap:** Blade Lord Ta'yak casts **Overwhelming Assault** on his current target. This ability deals a significant amount of physical damage and applies a debuff that increases subsequent damage from this ability by 100%. You must tank swap after each cast. The off-tank should taunt immediately after the ability hits the main tank.
    * **Positioning:** Tank the boss in the center of the room. When Ta'yak casts **Tempest Slash**, a tornado will spawn in front of the tank. You should aim this tornado away from the raid to prevent anyone from accidentally getting hit.
    * **Phase 2:** During the wind phase (**Storm Unleashed**), you will be moved to the back of the room. Your job is to run back to the boss while avoiding tornadoes. Use any available movement abilities or cooldowns to help you.

### **Healers (Staceyxoxoxo & Ennk)**

* **Raid Damage:** Be prepared for periods of intense raid-wide damage, particularly from **Unseen Strike** and **Wind Step**.
* **Tank Healing:** Pay close attention to the tanks and be ready to use cooldowns on the tank who has just taken **Overwhelming Assault**.
* **Specific Duties:**
    * **Unseen Strike:** This is the most important healing mechanic. When Ta'yak casts this, a raid member will be targeted with a red arrow. The entire raid must stack on this person to split the massive damage. Be ready with strong healing cooldowns during and after this ability, as the raid will take a burst of damage.
    * **Wind Step:** After Ta'yak blinks to a random player, everyone within 8 yards will get a bleed debuff. This will require sustained raid-wide healing. Be proactive with your healing over time spells and prepare for the damage.
    * **Phase 2:** During the wind phase, players will take continuous raid damage while running back to the boss. Keep your raid healing spells active and use raid cooldowns if necessary.

### **Melee DPS (StabyStabby & Danifaye)**

* **StabyStabby (Assassination Rogue) & Danifaye (Arms Warrior):**
    * **Primary Target:** Your main focus is the boss. There are no adds to worry about.
    * **Positioning:** Stand behind the boss to maximize your damage and avoid the tank-facing abilities.
    * **Unseen Strike:** When you see a red arrow on a player, immediately move to them and stack up with the rest of the raid. You will be knocked back, but the damage will be split among the group.
    * **Wind Step:** As soon as you see the boss disappear and reappear on a random player, make sure you are not within 8 yards of that player to avoid the bleed debuff. Immediately move back to the boss and continue your rotation.
    * **Phase 2:** During the wind phase, you must run back to the boss while avoiding tornadoes. Use your movement abilities (**Charge**, **Sprint**, **Shadowstep**) to get back quickly and safely.

### **Ranged DPS (Shootinguatm, Zurk, Blonker & Scumlyfe)**

* **Shootinguatm (Beast Master Hunter), Zurk (Survival Hunter), Blonker (Survival Hunter) & Scumlyfe (Affliction Warlock):**
    * **Primary Target:** You should be focused on the boss at all times.
    * **Positioning (Phase 1):** You will be constantly changing your position.
        * **Spread Out:** During the majority of the fight, you should be spread out at least 8 yards from other players to avoid the bleed damage from **Wind Step**.
        * **Stack Up:** When a player gets a red arrow above their head for **Unseen Strike**, immediately run to that player and stack tightly to split the damage.
    * **Avoid Tornadoes:** The boss will spawn tornadoes around the room with **Tempest Slash**. These tornadoes will move slowly. Your job is to avoid them at all costs, as they deal damage and knock you back.
    * **Phase 2:** At 20% health, the boss will cast **Storm Unleashed**, trapping the raid in a tornado and moving you to the back of the room. This is a DPS race.
        * **Dodge:** Run back to the boss while avoiding the moving tornadoes. Getting hit will send you back to the start and waste valuable time.
        * **Burn:** Once you reach the boss, use all your available cooldowns and burst damage to kill him before the raid is overwhelmed by the soft enrage (**Intensify**) and the growing number of tornadoes.

### **General Tips for Everyone**

* **Soft Enrage:** Ta'yak has a soft enrage with his **Intensify** ability, which increases his damage and haste over time. The quicker you can kill him, the less of a factor this will be.
* **Communication:** Call out when you are targeted by **Unseen Strike** to help your raid members stack on you faster.
* **Cooldowns:** Save major damage cooldowns for Phase 2 to ensure you can burn the boss down quickly.
* **Practice Makes Perfect:** The key to this fight is getting the timing of the stack and spread mechanics down. Don't be discouraged if you wipe a few times. Once you get the rhythm, the fight is much easier.

Good luck!
