The core mechanics of the fight remain the same as Normal mode, but Heroic difficulty adds a new, lethal ability in Phase 1 and a significantly more challenging Phase 2. The importance of raid awareness and perfect execution is now much higher.

---

### **Raid-wide Strategy**

This fight is a test of raid awareness and positioning. The fight consists of two phases: a main phase that repeats until the boss reaches low health, and a movement-intensive wind phase. The key is to respond correctly to the boss's abilities, which force you to either spread out or stack up. The key difference on Heroic is the new **Overhead Slash** ability and a much more difficult Phase 2.

### **Tanks (Cmdrboxhead & Anziano)**

* **Tank Swap:** Blade Lord Ta'yak casts **Overwhelming Assault** on his current target. This ability deals a significant amount of physical damage and applies a debuff that increases subsequent damage from this ability by 100%. You must tank swap after each cast. The off-tank should taunt immediately after the ability hits the main tank.
* **Positioning:** Tank the boss in the center of the room. When Ta'yak casts **Tempest Slash**, a tornado will spawn in front of the tank. You should aim this tornado away from the raid to prevent anyone from accidentally getting hit.
* **HEROIC MODE ONLY - Phase 2:** During the wind phase (**Storm Unleashed**), you will be moved to the back of the room. Your job is to navigate the **Windwall** and run back to the boss while avoiding tornadoes and the **Gusting Wind** knockback. Use any available movement abilities or cooldowns to help you.

### **Healers (Staceyxoxoxo & Ennk)**

* **Raid Damage:** Be prepared for periods of intense raid-wide damage, particularly from **Unseen Strike** and **Wind Step**.
* **Tank Healing:** Pay close attention to the tanks and be ready to use cooldowns on the tank who has just taken **Overwhelming Assault**.
* **Unseen Strike:** This is the most important healing mechanic. When Ta'yak casts this, a raid member will be targeted with a red arrow. The entire raid must stack on this person to split the massive damage. Be ready with strong healing cooldowns during and after this ability, as the raid will take a burst of damage.
* **Wind Step:** After Ta'yak blinks to a random player, everyone within 8 yards will get a bleed debuff. This will require sustained raid-wide healing. Be proactive with your healing over time spells and prepare for the damage.
* **HEROIC MODE ONLY - Overhead Slash:** This new ability will target a random player with a red circle on the ground and a red arrow overhead. The targeted player will take massive damage, and anyone else in the circle will also be hit. You must be ready to use major healing cooldowns on the targeted player to keep them alive.
* **HEROIC MODE ONLY - Phase 2:** During the wind phase, players will take continuous raid damage while running back to the boss. You must keep your raid healing spells active and use raid cooldowns to mitigate damage from **Gusting Wind**.

### **Melee DPS (StabyStabby & Danifaye)**

* **Primary Target:** Your main focus is the boss. There are no adds to worry about.
* **Positioning:** Stand behind the boss to maximize your damage and avoid the tank-facing abilities.
* **Unseen Strike:** When you see a red arrow on a player, immediately move to them and stack up with the rest of the raid. You will be knocked back, but the damage will be split among the group.
* **Wind Step:** As soon as you see the boss disappear and reappear on a random player, make sure you are not within 8 yards of that player to avoid the bleed debuff.
* **HEROIC MODE ONLY - Overhead Slash:** When you see a red circle appear on the ground, immediately move out of it. If the red arrow is on you, you must use a defensive cooldown to survive the massive damage and run out of the circle immediately to protect your raid.
* **HEROIC MODE ONLY - Phase 2:** During the wind phase, you must navigate the **Windwall** and run back to the boss while avoiding tornadoes and the **Gusting Wind** knockback. Use your movement abilities (**Charge**, **Sprint**, **Shadowstep**) to get back quickly and safely.

### **Ranged DPS (Shootinguatm, Zurk, Blonker & Scumlyfe)**

* **Primary Target:** You should be focused on the boss at all times.
* **Positioning (Phase 1):** You will be constantly changing your position.
    * **Spread Out:** During the majority of the fight, you should be spread out at least 8 yards from other players to avoid the bleed damage from **Wind Step**.
    * **Stack Up:** When a player gets a red arrow above their head for **Unseen Strike**, immediately run to that player and stack tightly to split the damage.
* **Avoid Tornadoes:** The boss will spawn tornadoes around the room with **Tempest Slash**. Your job is to avoid them at all costs, as they deal damage and knock you back.
* **HEROIC MODE ONLY - Overhead Slash:** This ability will target a random ranged player with a red circle on the ground and a red arrow overhead. You must move out of the circle if you are not the target. If you are the target, use a defensive cooldown to survive and move out of the circle as soon as the attack lands.
* **HEROIC MODE ONLY - Phase 2:** At 20% health, the boss will cast **Storm Unleashed**, trapping the raid in a tornado and moving you to the back of the room. This is a DPS race.
    * **The Windwall:** A wall of moving tornadoes will block your path back to the boss. You must find the open gaps in the wall to move through it.
    * **Gusting Wind:** A new ability will hit you with a strong knockback. You must position yourself so that this knockback does not push you into a tornado.
    * **Burn:** Once you reach the boss, use all your available cooldowns and burst damage to kill him before the raid is overwhelmed by the soft enrage and the growing number of tornadoes.
